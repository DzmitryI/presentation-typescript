My name is **Dmitry Ivanov**  
(Slide - with TypeScript)  
I would like to speak about the TypeScript language. So, what is TypeScript?  
**TypeScript** is a programming language introduced by Microsoft in 2012. It is positioned as a web application development tool that extends JavaScript.  
(Slide - with JS+TS)  
TypeScript was created by Anders Hejlsberg (Андерс Хейлсберг), he created Turbo Pascal, Delphi and C#. 

## Features of TypeScript  
(Slide - with Features of TypeScript)
There are several features of TypeScript:  
**TypeScript is just JavaScript.** It means that TypeScript starts with JavaScript and ends with JavaScript. Typescript adopts the basic building blocks of your program from JavaScript. So, you only need to know JavaScript to use TypeScript.

**TypeScript supports other JavaScript libraries.** It means that compiled TypeScript can be consumed from any JavaScript code. JavaScript, generated  by TypeScript, can reuse JavaScript frameworks, tools, and libraries.

**JavaScript is TypeScript.** It means that any valid .js file can be renamed to .ts files and can be compiled with other TypeScript files.    
**TypeScript is portable.** It means that TypeScript is portable across browsers, devices, and operating systems. It can run on any environment that JavaScript runs on. TypeScript doesn’t need a specific runtime environment.    

## Why Use TypeScript?  
(Slide - with Why_typescript)  
Why do we use TypeScript?
**The first** reason why we use TypeScript is that TypeScript is a strongly typed and compiled language.
However, the output of the compiler creates the same JavaScript that is then executed by the browser. Strict typing reduces the number of potential errors that might occur when developed in JavaScript.    
**The second** We use TypeScript because it implements many concepts that are common to object-oriented languages, such as inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and modifiers of access, and so on.    
**The third** TypeScript makes it faster and easier to write large complex programs, so they are easier to maintain, develop, scale and test than standard JavaScript.    
**The forth** We use TypeScript because it is developed as an opensource project and, like many projects, is hosted on github.It is cross-platform, which means that we can use both Windows and MacOS or Linux for development.    

## Components of TypeScript 
(Slide - with Typescript Components)  
TypeScript has three components:
I will speak about language now   
**Language** − It includes syntax, keywords, and type annotations.  
As for **The TypeScript Compiler** − it converts the instructions written in TypeScript to its JavaScript equivalent.  
**The TypeScript Language Service** − The language service supports the common set of a typical editor operations like statement completions, signature help, code formatting and outlining, colorization, etc.  
Thank you for attention
